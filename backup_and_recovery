Backups and Recovery
Premise
"I thought I was on my development machine and Iâ€™ve accidentally dropped a collection in production."The backup system captured its most recent backup last night,
 which is in the /home/ec2-user/scripts/dump directory, but the system subsequently continued to accumulate new data through the night. You need to restore your 
 data to the point in time just before the you dropped the collection.The collection is test.users and the total number of documents prior to the drop was 20,000.
